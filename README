This Application demonstrates one of the ways RESTFUL Webservices can be built without using HTTP for REST
Uses a Javascript client to capture and validate user input , uses a PHP middleware layer for demonstration of JSON RPC using 
sockets to send data to Java Server. Backend uses POJO's (Plain Old Java Objects) for database interactions.



SETUP INSTRUCTIONS 

1)SET THE DATABASE PROPERTIES and JAVA SERVER port in config.properties 
2)The php folder contains 5 files (3 php files and one js and one css file)

   validation.php- contains regex for user input validation
   client.php - contains all the methods to interact with Java server
   index.php - user input form 
   
   index.js- parses json response, makes AJAX calls to php server and contains DOM manipulation code

3) config.properties has to be in the BIN folder (same location as the the rit756 package and NOT inside the package).
   ie if compiled java class files are in /usr/bin/assignment/rit756 then config.properties has to reside in /usr/bin/assignment/
